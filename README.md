# Structural Madness Framework (SMF)

**Version 1 — Open, non-final**

Structural Madness Framework (SMF) is a framework for understanding and regulating systems  
(human, social, technical) through **observation, subtraction, and non-freezing coherence**.

It does not aim at truth.
It aims at **structural coherence**, even if temporary.

## What this is

- A framework, not a doctrine
- A tool for systems, not a prescription for people
- A way to reduce constraint, not add rules
- A living document

SMF works by:
- delaying interpretation
- suspending automatic execution
- preserving possibility
- avoiding final states

---

## What this is NOT

- Not a belief system to adopt
- Not a moral framework
- Not an optimization promise
- Not complete — and never will be

---

## Status

This is **version 1**.  
Open, provisional, and intentionally incomplete.

> Structural Madness will never end.
